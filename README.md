Programming 209 - Homework 2

Instructions for this Assignment: 

Go to GitHub and create a repo, I suggest calling it P209HW2
Then using local git, clone that.  
Open the new folder and add an HTML, CSS, and JS file.
Code the HTML to use a Form.  

The form should have a set of 3 radio buttons where the user can specify a pizza size of small, medium, or large.

a dropdown feature (a select) where they can specify if they want no toppings, one topping, or 2 toppings. 

There should be a form submit button

When the user clicks the submit, your JS code should calculate the price and show it to the user.

Use this pricing.  
	Small $7.00
	Medium  $10.00
	Large  $14.00
	1 topping  $2.00
	2 toppings $3.00

When you have debugged the project, do the 

git add *

git commit -m â€œfirst submission of pizza program

git push
